			"abstract": "The relationship between humans and machines, especially in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is shaped by hopes, concerns, and moral questions. On the one hand, advances in AI offer great promise: it can help us solve complex problems, improve healthcare, streamline workflows, and much more. Yet, at the same time, there are legitimate concerns about the control over this technology, its potential impact on jobs and society, and ethical issues related to discrimination and the loss of human autonomy. In the talk I shall will explore and illustrate the complex tension between innovation and moral responsibility in AI research.",

That means any logical arrangement of text, upon rendering, explodes into dummy visual shards of data that literally portrait the bigger picture for the human eye to perceive, but no longer convey the information computers should grasp. Such a bottleneck already makes proper ingestion of text-only documents a big challenge, let alone when tables or figures come into play, the ultimate nightmare for PDF parsers, not to say developers. The rest you must have already foreseen: a RAG system barfing unreliable knowledge from bad chunks (based on regular PDF parsing), if those ever get to be retrieved from a vector database. In this talk you can gather some vision-driven insights on how to leverage the strengths of PDF and language models towards good chunks to be ingested. Or, in other words, how multimodal models can go beyond trivial reverse engineering by decomposing tables into its building blocks, in plain language, as how those would be explained to another human; or better yet, as how humans would ask questions about such pieces of knowledge. And from such a strategy, we transfer the same rationale to figures. Come along, gather some insights, and get inspired to break down tables and figures from your own PDFs, and to improve retrieval in your RAG systems.",

From potential algorithmic bias to opaque decision-making processes, trust and fairness are at stake. In this talk,I will show how Explainable AI (XAI) can offer practical solutions to these ethical dilemmas. Instead of focusing on the technical underpinnings, we will discuss how transparency, accountability, and fairness can be enhanced in AI-driven transportation systems. Using a real-world example, I will demonstrate how XAI provides the groundwork for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially responsible AI solutions in public transportation systems.",

Through real-world examples and insights from conversations with graingert, co-author of Python's Anyio, we'll explore how each language approaches asynchronous execution, highlighting similarities and differences in syntax, performance, and ecosystem support. \r\n\r\nThis talk aims to persuade you that by leveraging Rust's powerful type system and compiler guarantees, we can build fast, reliable async code that's less prone to race conditions and concurrency bugs. Whether you're a Pythonista venturing into Rust or a Rustacean curious about Python's concurrency model, this session will provide practical insights to help you navigate async programming across both languages.\r\n\r\nWelcome to R\u00fcstzeit: Prepare to navigate async programming across both ecosystems.",

As machine learning stories go, this is a story of change, adaptation and making things work. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll share some practical lessons: how we evolved from a mono-package with four people working on it to multiple open-source packages with 40+ internal and external collaborators. Specifically, how we managed the explosion of over 300 config options without losing all of our sanity, building a separation of packages that works for both researchers and operations teams, as well as CI/CD and testing that constrains how many bugs we can introduce in a given day. You'll learn concrete patterns for growing Python packaging for ML systems, and balancing research flexibility with production stability. As a bonus, I'll sprinkle in anecdotes where LLMs like chatGPT and Copilot massively failed at facilitating this evolution.\r\n\r\nJoin me for a deep dive into the real challenges of scaling ML systems - where the weather may be hard to predict, but our code doesn't have to be.",

Even worse, humans interacting with the model may adjust their behaviour to the model making the gap between original training environment and deployment even larger. When deployed in a public environment the model may be exposed to users trying to game the system.

However, when building production-ready data pipelines, we encountered limitations of these libraries. Specifically, we were missing support for strict static type checking, validation of interdependent data frames, and graceful validation including introspection of failures.\r\n\r\nTo remedy the shortcomings of these libraries, we started building `dataframely` at the beginning of last year. Dataframely is a declarative data frame validation library with first-class support for polars data frames.\r\n\r\nOver the last year, we have gained experience in using `dataframely` both for analytical and production code across several projects. The result was a drastic improvement of the legibility of our pipeline code and our confidence in its correctness. To enable the wider data engineering community to benefit from similar effects, we have recently open-sourced `dataframely` and are keen on introducing it in this talk.",

These request-response mechanisms introduce latency, as clients must continually query the server to check for changes, often receiving redundant or outdated information. This approach leads to increased network overhead, inefficient use of server resources and diminished scalability as the number of clients or requests grows. Additionally, frequent requests expand the attack surface, requiring security measures to mitigate risks such as (un-)authorised access, rate limiting and query sanitisation. Managing all of these inherent problem results in increasingly complex systems to maintain and improve while putting considerable implementation effort onto the customer.\r\nJoin to find out how transitioning to a streaming architecture can address these issues by providing proactive, event-based data delivery, reducing latency, minimising redundant processing, enhancing scalability and simplifying security management.",

Furthermore we will touch on the topic of regulatory requirements in trading.\r\n\r\nThese challenges will be addressed through a distributed system implemented in Python, utilizing Kafka for real-time data streaming, PostgreSQL for persistent storage and DuckDB for high-performance analysis. We will examine approaches to decouple the components to re-use and scale them across different markets.\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency markets are used as a proving ground for the PoC due to easy availability for everyone.",

Our RAG chatbot for R&D experts accesses over 50,000 documents across numerous SharePoint sites and other sources. We identified three key success factors:\r\n1. Developing a robust data pipeline that syncs documents from source systems and that handles enterprise features such as replicating user permissions. \r\n2. Establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework with a clear optimization metric.\r\n3. Driving adoption through an onboarding training and ongoing user engagement, such as regular office hours.\r\n\r\nWe think that many of these lessons are broadly applicable to RAG chatbots, making this talk valuable for practitioners aiming to implement GenAI solutions in business contexts.",

I will also present my framework, Cadwyn, that allows you to support hundreds of API versions with ease -- based on FastAPI and inspired by Stripe's approach to API versioning.\r\n\r\nAfter this session, you will understand which approach to pick for your company to make your versioning cost effective and maintainable without investing too much into it.",

More recently, we are striving to keep up with PyData community's ongoing push for dataframe-agnosticism.\r\nWhile `glum` was originally heavily based on `pandas`, with the help of `narwhals`, we are close to being able to fit models on any dataset that the latter supports.

We\u2019ll also discuss best practices for defining resource lifecycles to ensure easy maintainability and consistency across deployments.

This not only increase the speed but also makes the whole task more optimized and memory efficient.\r\n\r\nThe library gives many vector database supports, like Pinecone, Weavaite, and Elastic.",
